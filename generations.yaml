    description: "The Hyundai Tucson Hybrid is based on the fourth-generation Tucson platform, sharing its revolutionary 'parametric dynamics' design with jewel-like surface details, hidden daytime running lights that blend into the grille when not illuminated, and angular styling elements. Visually nearly identical to the conventional Tucson apart from hybrid badging and minor trim differences, it maintains the dramatic styling that differentiates this generation from its competitors and predecessors. Powered by a hybrid system combining a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a 44.2 kW electric motor and 1.49 kWh lithium-ion battery, producing a combined 226 HP and 258 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through a six-speed automatic transmission specifically designed for hybrid applications, available with either front-wheel drive or HTRAC all-wheel drive. The interior features the same minimalist, technology-focused design as the standard Tucson, with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and touch-sensitive controls. Providing approximately 20-30% better fuel efficiency than the conventional gasoline models while delivering more power and responsive acceleration, it sacrifices no interior space due to the compact battery placement under the rear seats. The hybrid model sits in the middle of the Tucson's electrified lineup, between the conventional gasoline models and the plug-in hybrid variant which offers pure electric driving capability. As Hyundai's first hybrid compact SUV in many markets, the Tucson Hybrid represents an important part of the company's electrification strategy, offering a balance between efficiency and conventional usability that has made it a popular choice among buyers transitioning toward electrified vehicles."
